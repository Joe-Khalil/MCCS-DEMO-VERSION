 Limitations:
 
- Added alternative internet server (can up to 40 MBPS with IDM) auto-connect if main internet server fails to connect (you can use download accelerator software: IDM, FDM,... on server 2).

- The network speed maximum is about 100 MBPS. Don't try to install VPN Sofware on VM (this will not work, exclude VPN extension on browser can be used).

- If the main network disconnect or not work, wait until an alternative internet server setup dialog appears (about 60s) or you must go to azure portal > all resources > select all (uncheck cloudshell) then delete and re-run the script again.
